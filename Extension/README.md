# Dark Pattern Highlighter Browser Extension
This tool, developed by the informatics part of the [dapde-project](https://dapde.de/), is intended to help consumers to navigate the internet in a way similar to an ad blocker. However, the highlighter differs from ad blockers in one crucial aspect: it does not block individual dark patterns on websites but highlights them so that consumers become aware of the influences affecting them. In addition, the tool informs about the type of pattern.

## Features
- Automatic detection of dark patterns on web pages
- Highlighting of suspicious elements with minimal impact on page appearance
- Popup window providing information on detected dark patterns, including their category and an explanation
